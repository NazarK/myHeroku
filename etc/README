ONE LINE DEPLOY SCRIPTS 
(inspired by Heroku)

SETTING UP DEV ENVIRONMENT

  git clone [REPOSITORY URL]
  cd [CODE FOLDER]
  git remote rename origin github
  [MAKE CHANGES]
  etc/deploy "optional comment"

  * - to avoid entering root password on every deploy, add your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
  to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on server


SCRIPTS

  etc/deploy "optional comment" - deploy script, deploys latest changes
  etc/conf - configuration variables
  etc/log - same as "heroku logs -t"
  etc/console - same as "heroku run console"
  etc/shell - start shell in app folder
