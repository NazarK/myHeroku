one line deploy scripts (inspired by Heroku)
2013 NK

you should have you ssh keys (id_rsa.pub) added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on server, 
otherwise you will have to enter root password on every deploy

repository on local machine should be named github

etc/deploy "optional comment" - deploy script, deploys latest changes
etc/conf - configuration variables
etc/log - same as "heroku logs -t"
etc/console - same as "heroku run console"
etc/shell - start shell in app folder
